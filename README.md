# EquisdeVRS

Virus created originaly for [Patreons](https://www.patreon.com/WorcomeStudios).

## About

Equisde, is a Windows virus so simple, so good.
Initially it belongs to us, but Worcome Studios expropriated the rights and transformed it into an open source project for the community to learn to create their virus that they could nurture in unimaginable ways.

We do not design it to harm, it is only a test that helps us to know the methods used by the basic cyber-criminals of the internet. Similarly, we are ashamed to say that we received outside help for the construction of this software. Damn Corigiath group!


### The project

EquisdeVRS was programmed in Visual Studio 2017 with the WinForms or VB.NET language.

It is currently being developed without the help of [Worcome Studios(http://worcomestudios.comule.com/).

Currently you can help us with some little things that we still can't add, it would be great.

## Contributing

We appreciate all contributions to improve Equisde.
